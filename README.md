# SHAHYAK â€“ AI Health Assistant

SHAHYAK is an intelligent and interactive healthcare platform that simulates real-time consultation experiences using AI, voice, vision, and text capabilities. It supports users in understanding their health conditions and connects them with professionals when needed.

## Key Features

### AI Consultation (Multi-Modal)
- Text Input: Users can describe their symptoms in a textbox.
- Voice Input: Speech is converted to text and analyzed.
- Image Upload: Upload symptom images, prescriptions, or reports.
- Camera Input: Capture live images for consultation.

### Smart AI Diagnosis
- Processes multimodal input using NLP and computer vision.
- Provides possible diagnoses and health suggestions.
- Recommends tests or home remedies.
- Alerts users if they should consult a human doctor.

### Live Voice-Based AI Call
- Real-time two-way voice conversation with the AI assistant.
- Mute/unmute controls.
- Realistic spoken responses using ElevenLabs.

### Professional & Doctor Features
- Doctor sign-up and profile management.
- Doctors can view user consultation history and session summaries.
- Interactive dashboard for doctors to stay connected with patients.

### NGO & Health Organization Portal
- NGOs can register, manage profiles, and post upcoming health-related events.
- Events such as blood donation camps, awareness programs, and free health checkups can be listed.
- Public /events page to view upcoming camps with locations and descriptions.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

### AI & Tools
- OpenAI or Groq API for natural language processing
- ElevenLabs API for realistic voice responses
- Image analysis model (custom or pretrained)
- OpenStreetMap for location-based features
